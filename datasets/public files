## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

For this analysis, I used the **2024 full year of Cyclistic Bike-Share data (Janâ€“Dec 2024)**.  
The dataset includes 12 monthly Excel files with details of each ride:

- Rider type (casual vs. member)  
- Bike type (classic, docked, electric)  
- Trip start and end times  
- Ride duration  
- Ride start and end stations  

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, only selected sample files are uploaded here in `/data/`.  
ðŸ‘‰ The full dataset is available publicly from Divvy:
