# 🚴 Cyclistic Bike-Share: Member vs Casual Rider Insights

This repository contains my **Capstone Project** from the Google Data Analytics case study *“How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?”*.  
The analysis explores the differences in riding patterns between **casual riders** and **annual members**, with the goal of identifying strategies to convert casuals into members for sustainable revenue growth.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Tooling:** Power BI, Power Query (Excel), DAX  

**Business Challenge:**  
Membership riders generate more **stable recurring revenue** than casual riders. Although memberships are greater, casuals still make up a significant share.  
👉 The key question: *How can Cyclistic convert more casual riders into members while sustaining existing growth?*
